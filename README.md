Exploring AliciaOnline.


## State of the work
The years I spent on reverse-engineering the whole thing have drained my motivation to continue. 
It's not impossible to write a new backend for Alicia, but it's not worth my time. 
Also writing a proper repacker with GUI for the assets is curicial for continuation in development. 

Writing this here to let anybody who wants to continue in my work, please remind me that it was all worth it with a star on this repository. I can share any knowledge I have, just contact me.
